    {\bf Conjecture 1:}

    \hspace{.5in}$\displaystyle x^n=\sum^{n}_{i=1}y_i^n$ has an integer solution such that $y_i\ne x, \forall i$.

\section{Introduction}
The objective of this project is to investigate the conjecture above: whether or not we can always find at least one integer solution to equations of the form $x^n=y_0^n+\cdot\cdot\cdot+y_n^n$ given any $x$, excluding trivial solutions involving $y_i$'s$=0$ or $x$. This project will be a Type II project. \\

Some of this investigation and research will involve:
\begin{itemize}    
    \item Finding parameters and conditions for possible valid solutions
    \item Computational analysis on random integers raised to the power of $n$ and finding an integer solution to the sum.
    \item Noting differences between even and odd $n$.
    \item Identifying different families of solutions that take on a similar form.
\end{itemize}

Though this conjecture may be false, we hope to investigate as much as we can on the matter and provide some deeper research to the subject.

\section{Patterns of Powers}
In order to find solutions for different $n$ we investigated checking the reduced residues if $x^n$ mod $N$ so that we could eliminate solutions that would not lead to a possible solution. 

\vspace{.1in}

While investigating different positive integers $n$ and $N$ we found certain patterns for reduced residues. 

\vspace{.1in}

Let $A$ be the sequence $A = \{0^n,1^n,2^n,3^n,4^n,5^n,...\}$, and $A_r = \{a$ mod $N\}_{a\in A}$ be the reduced residue of $A$ mod $N$. Here may be some potential conjetures on the set $A$ given the data we have collected:

\vspace{.1in}

{\bf Conjecture 2:} If $n$ is even, every other element starting with the first in $A_r$ is $0$, $A_r=\{0,\_,0,\_,0,\_,...\}$, for $N=2^d$ for all integers $d$. \\
    \hspace{.2in} i.e. $a_{2i}=0$, where $a_{2i}\in A_r$ is the $2i^{th}$ element in $A_r$. \\
